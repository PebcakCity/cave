Blazor thoughts:

With the Blazor server app, how can we pass a list (or dictionary) of input
names to a DeviceController component?  There are several ways to pass data from
one component to another:
Route parameters, query strings, component parameters, state containers...
The best fit is probably to use a mix of component parameters and a singleton
service that contains the whole configuration.  Config would get loaded and be
available to the HomePage so it would have a reference to each Device for
SelectSource to use.

Component parameters:

[Index page]

@for( int i = 0; i < DeviceList.Count; i++ )
{
    <DeviceController Device="@DeviceList[i]"/>
}

@code
{
    // get list of devices
    List<Device> DeviceList = ...
}

[DeviceController page]

@code
{
    [Parameter]
    public Device Device { get; set; }
}

Singleton Service

[Program.cs]

builder.Services.AddSingleton<AppConfig>();

[Shared/AppConfig.cs]

public class AppConfig
{
    public string RoomName {get; protected set;}
    public Dictionary<string, Device> Devices {get; protected set;}
    public Dictionary<string, List<KeyValuePair>>> Sources {get; protected set;}
    //...
}

[Component]
@inject AppConfig appConfig;

...
