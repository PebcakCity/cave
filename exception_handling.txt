Loud logging: logging an error message with particular messaging that we
could search log files for, possibly in all caps, with decorators around it,
etc.  Also possibly rethrowing with our own name.


--------------------------------------------------


Should we make response.IndicatesFailure check for length >= 7?
    pros:
        1. we don't have to worry about throwing out of range when checking
           this in every controller method
        2. ?
    cons:
        1. if NEC changes firmware & every response is no longer >= 7 bytes
           we won't catch these errors any more.  not likely but possible?
        2. ?

What if we instead make a second property/method for determining a) if Data[0]
starts 'a' something and b) if the data is longer than 7/8 bytes?

If typical command failure responses are x number of bytes, we might shave a
tiny bit by checking up front whether the response is exactly x bytes or longer

If longer, continue on with the rest of the method.

Is that useful?  Does it eliminate any code from controller methods or make
them any simpler?

class Response
{
    ...
    public bool HasErrorCode
    {
        get => ( this.IndicatesFailure && this.Data.Length >= 7 ); 
    }

    or even

    public (int, int)? GetErrorTuple
    {
        if ( this.IndicatesFailure && this.Data.Length >= 7 )
            return (Data[5], Data[6]);
        return null;
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------


NECProjectorCommandException needs optional Command argument so it can add
command name to exception data.  Could help make logs easier to read.

NECProjectorCommandException.CreateNewFromValues(int, int, Command? command)
    1. create exception instance out of values in data
    2. add ErrorCode, whatever good that does
    3. if command isn't null, add the command name too


GetLampInfo(LampInfo lampInfo)
{
    var response = ...
    if (response.IndicatesFailure)
        throw NECProjectorCommandException.CreateNewFromValue(
            response.GetErrorTuple(), Command.GetLampInfo
        );
}

General exception flow
----------------------

client.sendcommandasync
    // send command, get response
    ...
    if response length is 0
        _log socket/serial exception_
        throw (back to controller)
    return response



getlampinfo
    // device apparently doesn't have a lamp, user doesn't need to know
    if response indicates failure && response length >= 7
        log the error
        don't throw
    else
        ...


any other controller method
    try
        var response = sendcommand...
        ...

    // GUI should be loud here so maybe user will tell IT
    catch socket/serial exception (NO data returned)
        don't log it (already logged)
        throw (back to GUI to notify user)

    // user will get notice command wasn't accepted & _might_ tell IT
    catch bad command exception (device says command unrecognized)
        _package command in exception data, see above_
        log it
        throw (back to GUI to notify user)

    // Means power state or input value was not found in API, meaning our
    // API is out of date.  Log should be LOUD, GUI silent.
    // *** instead of allowing an exception like this to happen, we can use
    // TryGetValue/TryFromValue.  If return value is false, we throw OUR OWN
    // exception that we can log & search for more easily ***
    catch value not found exception
        log it LOUD
        don't throw

    // index out of range means we either didn't get the full response
    // (bad connection?) OR can mean our API is out of date
    catch index out of range exception
        log it LOUD
        don't throw

    catch any other exception
        log it regular
        don't throw


GUImethod
    try
        whatever

    catch socket/serial exception
        toast: tell user of SERIOUS issue

    catch bad command exception
        toast: tell user minor issue occurred, suggest power cycling device

    don't log anything (everything is already logged by this point)

To make socket & serial based clients work interchangeably, make them both throw
same exception on failure to complete read, probably TimeoutException as
SerialPort already throws this on failure to read.

SocketClient
{
    SendCommandAsync(...)
    {
    ...
        int bytesRead = await ReceiveAsync(...)
        if (bytesRead <= 0)
            throw new SocketException("SendCommandAsync: ReceiveAsync FAILED, check connection.");
            //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            // Do we use our own message here to log loudly, or do we just call SocketException()
            // to let the OS fill in the last error?  Does bytesRead == 0 absolutely mean there
            // was a socket error?
            // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socket.receive?view=net-7.0
            // "If the remote host shuts down the Socket connection with the Shutdown method, and all available data
            // has been received, the Receive method will complete immediately and return zero bytes."  This means the
            // host disconnected us and we're not getting any more data on this socket.

            // For Async versions, ReceiveAsync can throw SocketException on error accessing the socket, and some
            // versions of ReceiveAsync include language saying it will store in the returned task all exceptions
            // that can be thrown by its "synchronous counterpart".  Some of the variants do not include this language
            // in the comments.  ReceiveAsync(SocketAsyncEventArgs) says that bytesRead == 0 means a graceful shutdown
            // occurred with stream based (TCP) sockets and that "no more bytes will ever be read".  Doesn't really
            // sound like an OS error occurred and hence calling SocketException() default constructor might not provide
            // any useful info about what actually happened if it failed to get any bytes... So I lean toward throwing
            // an exception with a useful, searchable message.

    ...
        // Some OS socket problem
        catch(SocketException se)
        {
            Logger.Error(se);
            throw;
        }
    ...
        // Thrown when the cancellation token expires before ReceiveAsync finishes
        catch(OperationCanceledException)
        {
            TimeoutException te = new("SendCommandAsync: Send/receive operation timed out");
            te.Data.Add("Command", toSend);
            Logger.Error(te);
            throw te;
        }
    }
}

SerialClient
{
    SendCommandAsync(...)
    {
    ...
        // Thrown by Read() when no bytes are available
        catch(TimeoutException)
        {
            TimeoutException te = new("SendCommandAsync: Send/receive operation timed out")
            te.Data.Add("Command", toSend);
            Logger.Error(te);
            throw te;
        }
    }
}
