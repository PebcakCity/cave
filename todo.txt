Things to do/test/play with/figure out when I have time:

  - AppConfig injection

  - MySQL/MariaDB connector (simple version without EF/Identify, since all we're doing is a single query on startup).
    Local hashing, parameterized connection string.  User with only select privileges.

  - Modals.  Try to create a simple PIN entry component.

  - Store DB connection details in appSettings.json or elsewhere?
